* get kswapd to run on the non-boot CPU [DONE]
* Do TLB shootdowns after swapping out pages [DONE]
* Try to come up with errors in userland code having to with memory region locking.
  For instance, malloc some memory, sleep so it's paged out, then try reading a file into
  it and see what happens. [DONE]
  Answer: copyinstr, uio, copyin/copyout behaves correctly after testing. tm_badfaultfunc
  causes a fault, which causes PTEs to be checked, and the memory to be swapped back in. I think
  that covers the cases, since we don't move pages around right now. If we do start doing that, then
  I'll add the memory pinning and unpinning calls.
* Idea: add a new syscall that pages out a region, to facilitate testing so we don't have to rely
  solely on sleep() and page aging. [DONE]
* Get pipes working (pipe(2)), with blocking and non-blocking reads and buffering
* Get shared memory regions working
* Get mmap working
* Implement O_CLOEXEC on file descriptors
